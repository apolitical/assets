- Fonts - Fonts that we don't want to host with google
- Images - e.g profile images from most_influential lists

# Development processes
**Creating a new version of an existing list page**
see: [frontends/lists/README.md](https://gitlab.com/apolitical/frontends/lists/blob/master/README.md)

# Troubleshooting

1. Check that Cloudflare is not caching (leave it to GitHub)
2. Enforce HTTPS
3. Make a change to the repo and push it
